I initially started with Timlrx's [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog v1](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) awesome template as a starter, but for the most part, everything on this site is fully customized and coded by yours truly. I wanted to own my web content, not put it in control of a corporation.

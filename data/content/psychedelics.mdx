<Heading level="h1" text="Psychedelics" subtitle="A Catalyst for Healing:"/>

I'm an advocate for the safe, informed, respectful, and responsible usage of psychedelic medicine for consenting adults. Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin mushrooms, have fundamentally altered me as a person for the better and have profoundly aided in my spiritual healing & transformation.

I built [Microdose.wiki](https://microdose.wiki) with [Nick Renfro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickatparagon) to promote the safe and respectful usage of "microdosing" psychedelics, a practice that has been gaining popularity.

I am proud to live in Colorado, where this natural medicine is decriminalized, and access to these powerful healing substances is actively being expanded. I humbly offer **facilitation and integration support** to those seeking to explore the transformational potential of this healing medicine [^1].

<Testimonial quote="My journey with Darian brought new meaning to the terms “thinking” and “feeling”. As a think first, feel later type of person, the journey helped me deepen my perspective and understanding of self. Darian created the set and setting with care and intention, allowing me to pull back the curtain on myself and gain an intuition that is easy to pass by in everyday life. She was a thoughtful steward of the experience, helping me navigate complex feelings and encouraging me to go deeper. Since the journey, I feel more grounded and less restless, often reflecting on the wisdom I gained." author="T.R." />

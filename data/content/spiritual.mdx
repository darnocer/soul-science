## Overview

When I embarked on a quest of self-discovery, what I found was a calling for my life's work: <span className="bold-underline">to share deep healing with others</span>. I have known my whole life that I've wanted to serve others in a meaningful way, but it has taken some time over the last decade to both heal myself and unravel how to fully embrace my Path.

The road ahead is unclear and uncertain, as it is for any new adventure, but in 2025, I intend to build on my [existing experience](/work/management), and continue to learn, grow, and make new connections, opening myself to new opportunities along the way.

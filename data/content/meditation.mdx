[Psychedelics](/work/psychedelics) alone are not a panacea. The importance of cultivating Awareness in all areas of life through a meditation or mindfulness practice cannot be overstated. Meditation is a life-changing practice that allows us to deeply know ourselves, cultivate compassion, broaden our perspectives, develop mastery over our own minds, and find true inner peace.

Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my studies draw primarily from Taoist, Zen, and Buddhist traditions. While I still have much to learn, I acknowledge the teacher within me and feel called to support and inspire others on their Path. As I continue to deepen my own practice, I offer guidance and encouragement to those looking to do the same.

### Bodhisattva Vows 🙏🏼

In some Buddhist traditions, all practitioners are encouraged to become a **Bodhisattva**— one who dedicates themselves to awakening not just for their own benefit but for the liberation of all beings.

> There are numerous sentient beings in the universe  
> I vow to help them all to awaken
>
> My imperfections are inexhaustible
> I vow to overcome them all
>
> The Dharma is unknowable
> I vow to know it
>
> The way of Awakening is unattainable
> I vow to attain it

## Overview

For nearly a decade, I've worked in various technical and technical consulting roles from healthcare software implementation to marketing website operations, supporting project management, software & web development, quality assurance, workflow design & process improvement, and technical training for companies of all sizes.

Having successfully supported more than 60 major launches in my career with complex integrations, tight deadlines, and many moving parts, I'm comfortable navigating ambiguity, breaking complicated problems into manageable steps, and holding teams accountable to keep projects on track.

<span className="bold-underline">I'm currently open to paid work</span>, where I can support the implementation of meaningful initiatives with an organization whose mission is aligned to [my values](/work/spiritual).

As a jack-of-all-trades— with my breadth of experience, versatile skillset, and track record of successful project leadership— I'm an exceptional candidate for non-technical management roles as well ;)

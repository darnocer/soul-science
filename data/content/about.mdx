After a lifetime of struggling with anxiety and bipolar depression, it wasn't until hitting rock bottom with burnout after nearly a decade of working in tech that I was finally forced to confront the truth about my unhappiness. A **meditation** and **yoga** practice, in combination with **psychedelic** medicine, profoundly altered my life by enabling me to find inner peace and uncover a calling for my life's work.

I created **Soul Science Wellness** to support others on their spiritual journeys of healing, awakening, and transformation. I call it <span className="bold-underline">Transformational Wellness</span>: a holistic approach to well-being that integrates mind, body, and spirit, enabling us to not just survive, but _thrive_, and reach our highest potential.

I offer **spiritual mentorship**, guidance on **meditation practice**, and facilitation and integration support for **psychedelic healing** journeys. Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my work draws primarily from my nearly a decade of personal experience with yoga, meditation, and psychedelics; extensive study of psychedelic science, research, and policy; participation and training with various psychedelic organizations; and my studies of Eastern philosophy, particularly Taoist and Buddhist traditions.

If you feel called to explore your inner world more deeply, you're welcome to schedule a free <a href="https://calendly.com/soul-science/30" target="_blank">30-minute session</a> with me— no pressure, just an open space for connection and support.

Gaining deeper insights on my intentions, relationships with others, and my relationship with myself. Looking forward to taking my learnings into my daily practice!" author="A.E."/>

<Testimonial quote=" My journey with Darian brought new meaning to the terms “thinking” and “feeling”. As a think-first, feel-later type of person, the journey helped me deepen my perspective and understanding of self. Darian created the set and setting with care and intention, allowing me to pull back the curtain on myself and connect with an intuition that is easy to pass by in everyday life. Darian was a thoughtful steward of the experience, helping me navigate complex feelings and encouraging me to go deeper. Since the journey, I feel more grounded and less restless, often reflecting on the wisdom I gained." author="T.R."/>

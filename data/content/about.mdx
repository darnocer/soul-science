## Bio

After a lifetime of struggling with anxiety and bipolar depression, it wasn't until hitting rock bottom with burnout after nearly a decade of working in tech that I was finally forced to confront the truth about my unhappiness. A **meditation** and **yoga** practice, in combination with **psychedelic** medicine, profoundly altered my life by enabling me to find inner peace and uncover a calling for my life's work.

I created **Soul Science** to support others on their spiritual and healing journeys. I call my work <span className="bold-underline">Transformational Wellness</span>: a holistic approach to well-being that integrates mind, body, and spirit through practicing daily self-cultivation and connection to the present moment, inviting us to live more intentionally and authentically.

Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my work draws primarily from my nearly a decade of personal experience with yoga, meditation, and psychedelics; extensive study of psychedelic science, research, and policy; participation and training with various psychedelic organizations; and my studies and practice of Eastern philosophy, particularly Taoist and Buddhist traditions.

## Services

I offer:

- Spiritual mentorship and guidance on spiritual practice
- Individualized healing sessions utilizing tools like yoga, guided meditation, breathwork, energy work, and more
- Integration coaching and support for exploration of altered states

If you feel called to explore your inner world more deeply, you're welcome to schedule a free <a href="https://calendly.com/soulsciencehq/30" target="_blank">30-minute session</a> with me— no pressure, just an open space for connection and support.

## Testimonials

<Testimonial quote="My session with Darian was incredible. Darian provided a perfect container; sound, lights and more, making it feel cozy and comfortable. She was supportive and present ensuring a smooth experience. Using meditation and grounding techniques, it helped me focus on following up on my intentions. I especially appreciated the movement and stretches before and after to bring in awareness to the body! I came out feeling light, with a great sense of clarity. Gaining deeper insights on my intentions, relationships with others, and my relationship with myself. Looking forward to taking my learnings into my daily practice!" author="A.E."/>

<Testimonial quote=" My session with Darian brought new meaning to the terms “thinking” and “feeling”. As a think-first, feel-later type of person, the session helped me deepen my perspective and understanding of self. Darian created the set and setting with care and intention, allowing me to pull back the curtain on myself and connect with an intuition that is easy to pass by in everyday life. Darian was a thoughtful steward of the experience, helping me navigate complex feelings and encouraging me to go deeper. Since then, I feel more grounded and less restless, often reflecting on the wisdom I gained." author="T.R."/>

After a lifetime of struggling with anxiety and bipolar depression, it wasn't until hitting rock bottom with burnout after nearly a decade of working in tech that I was finally forced to confront the truth about my unhappiness. A **meditation** and **yoga** practice, in combination with **psychedelic** medicine, profoundly altered my life by enabling me to find inner peace and uncover a calling for my life's work.

I created **Soul Science Wellness** to support others on their spiritual journeys of healing, awakening, and transformation. I call it <span className="bold-underline">Transformational Wellness</span>: a holistic approach to well-being that integrates mind, body, and spirit, enabling us to not just survive, but _thrive_, and reach our highest potential.

I offer **spiritual mentorship**, guidance on **meditation practice**, and facilitation and integration support for **psychedelic healing** journeys. Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my work draws primarily from my nearly a decade of personal experience with yoga, meditation, and psychedelics; extensive study of psychedelic science, research, and policy; participation and training with various psychedelic organizations; and my studies of Eastern philosophy, particularly Taoist and Buddhist traditions.

If you feel called to explore your inner world more deeply, you're welcome to schedule a free <a href="https://calendly.com/soul-science/30" target="_blank">30-minute session</a> with meâ€” no pressure, just an open space for connection and support.

After a lifetime of struggling with depression and anxiety, it wasn't until hitting rock bottom with burnout that I was finally forced to confront the truth about my unhappiness. A **meditation** and **yoga** practice, in combination with **psychedelic** medicine, profoundly altered my life by enabling me to reconnect with my Highest Self and uncover my life's purpose.

I created **Soul Science Wellness** to support others on their spiritual journeys of healing, awakening, and transformation. Though I don't adhere to any particular doctrine, my work draws primarily from my studies in Eastern philosophy including Taoist, Zen, and Buddhist traditions, in addition to nearly a decade of personal experience on the spiritual Path. I also work with organizations including [Zendo Project](https://zendoproject.org), [Fireside Project](https://firesideproject.org), and [MAPS](https://maps.org).

I believe every person has the innate capacity to heal, and that the truth they seek is already within them. I embrace both spirituality and science as two sides of the same coin that each offer valuable insights into the truth about the nature of reality. My role is simply to facilitate that process of understanding, supporting those who are ready to reconnect with their own Inner Intelligence.

I offer facilitation and integration support for psychedelic journeys, as well as guidance for mindfulness, meditation, and spiritual mentorship. If you feel called to explore your inner world more deeply, you're welcome to schedule a free 30-minute session with meâ€” no pressure, just an open space for connection and support.

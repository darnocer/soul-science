Can you answer this question?

- _Who Am I?_

The answer to this question lies not in your race, gender, political views, occupation, or relationship status. 

The core of this question means to look beyond labels— to the essence of who you **truly** are.

It's okay if you've forgotten. We all do. 

In meditation, we sometimes ask ourselves: _"Who is having these thoughts?"_

Through a meditation practice, you learn who you **thought** you were is simply an ever-changing collection of beliefs, opinions, traits, and preferences. 

And you may struggle to find this thing you call _"I"_. 

Our thoughts are like clouds— constantly shifting. Sometimes light and fluffy, sometimes dark and stormy. But no matter what, there is always a blue sky underneath.

And _you_ are the ever-present blue sky. 

Of course, this is a metaphor, but the nature of "I" is worth investigating for yourself. 

**Try this**: For the next 30 days, ask yourself every day— _"Who am I?"_

Write it in your journal, sit with it in meditation, or silently and intentionally offer it as a prayer.

If you are committed to finding the answer, you need to ask the question. 

And if you're persistent about asking the question, you just may be surprised what you discover.

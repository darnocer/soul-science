> [!default] A note about harm reduction
> 
> Psychedelics have been used for thousands of years as tools for healing and self-discovery. While they can be transformative (and even, dare I say— fun!), they don't come without risks. Harm reduction means approaching the use of these powerful substances with proper education, preparation, and respect. This guide is not an endorsement of illegal drug use but a resource for those who have already made the decision to explore psychedelics to minimize potential harm. 

### Testing
For the most part, mushrooms are typically safe and synthetic ones are rare. For LSD, MDMA, and any other substance, **ALWAYS TEST YOUR SUPPLY**. 

Check out [Bunk Police](https://bunkpolice.com) or [DanceSafe](https://dancesafe.org) for test kits and information. 

Remember, _"if it's bitter, it's a spitter"_— real LSD should taste like paper. A metallic taste likely means it's a research chemical like 25i-NBOMe. But the only way to be _absolutely_ sure is to **test** it!

### Proper Storage
Store substances, especially mushrooms, in air-tight containers like mason jars— _not_ plastic baggies! Psilocybin degrades over time, especially in heat and light, meaning the mushrooms will lose potency if not stored properly. 

Mushrooms should be cracker-dry before storage to prevent mold and rot. Keep them in a dark, dry place with a desiccant or a drying agent. Do not put them in the refrigerator.

> Note that it's normal for psychoactive mushrooms bruise blue. Blue is indicative of psilocybin content. They may also have some white fuzziness at the bottom of the stems— this is mycelium. Mycelium is safe to consume, though it may mean the mushrooms were not grown in optimal conditions. If they look otherwise questionable, be sure to do some research on what contamination looks like. 

LSD can be stored in the freezer but must stay completely dry— since LSD is water-soluble, any ice or moisture could ruin the doses.

### Measure Your Dose 
Never "eyeball" your dose. 

While it's nearly impossible to consume a physiologically unsafe volume of mushrooms, taking more than you are prepared for can cause psychological distress. 

It is worth it to get a milligram scale off of Amazon for less than $20. Kitchen scales are not sufficient because they are often not sensitive enough. 

By weighing your dose, you can learn what the optimal dose is for you and compare it across strains. 

There's really no "standard" dose for mushrooms, but the threshold for tripping is, on average, 1-3g, depending on the strain and potency of the mushrooms. Note that's the weight of the dried mushroom material, not the dose of psilocybin. 

Unfortunately, it is difficult to know the dose of LSD on a blotter paper without access to a chemistry lab. On average, 1 tab is ~100ug. That's MICROGRAMS, 1000x smaller than 1 milligram (mg). But it completely depends, so start low. 

As for anything else, [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/) is a great resource for checking the proper dosages. 

### Set & Setting
This is the most important rule of Psychedelics: **Be mindful of your "Set" and "Setting"**. 

**Set** refers to your "mindset". Do not consume psychedelics if you are not in a positive headspace. 

**Setting** refers to your external environment— be in safe, comfortable environment with people you trust. 

Nearly all "bad trips," can be avoided with proper attention to Set and Setting. This does not mean that trips may not be difficult; but difficult trips are not necessarily bad. They are often conducive for true transformation. 

Psychedelics are _non-specific amplifiers_, meaning they amplify anything already present in your internal and external environments, so be sure to set yourself up for a positive experience. 

### Be Prepared
Do not consume a new substance for the first time in a public environment. 

Ensure your day and the following day is COMPLETELY free from obligations. Even the most minor task or responsibility can be overwhelming or feel like a massive challenge, especially while on psychedelics, but often even the day after. 

Respect yourself by ensuring you have enough time and space to both fully enjoy and recover from the experience. 

Plan ahead to minimize decisions. Small choices can often feel monumental on psychedelics. 

And of course, DO NOT DRIVE.

Pack a daypack with the essentials: 

* **WATER** - Stay hydrated
* **Healthy snacks** - You may not want to eat, but psychedelics burn a massive amount of energy. Fruit is always a good choice, or other light foods like nuts. Avoid meat, and you may be averse to it while on psychedelics. 
* **A jacket** - You may experience temperature shifts 
* **A safe pouch** - Keep your important stuff like phone, wallet, and keys in one place and don't touch them unless necessary 
* **Gum** - You may want to chew on something
* **Tissues** - For, you know, leakages
* **Chapstick** - Dry lips can be an uncomfortable distraction 
* **A power bank**- To charge your phone
* **Headphones** - To listen to music, which can take you deeper into the experience 
* **Sunglasses** - So you feel less exposed 
* **A toy** - A ball, frisbee, or flow toy can be fun and enjoyable 
* **A compass** - This might seem a little silly, but using a phone or maps can be challenging, so a compass can help you navigate 


### After Care
Know that psychedelics open you up in a way that you may not even realize. 

Do not call everyone you know the day after taking psychedelics to tell them about your revelations. Chances are, they won't understand. People mean well, but their words can often be detrimental to your growth and dilute something that may feel very significant to you. 

Do NOT make any life-altering decisions for _at least_ 2 weeks after the experience. The post-trip glow eventually fades, and you want to be grounded before making big choices that you may regret. 

Take time for yourself after the experience. Ideally you have a full day, if not days, to rest, relax, and recharge. Spend some time meditating, if that's part of your [practice](/practice). And journal about your experience. 

**Integration** is a somewhat nebulous term that refers to the process of applying insights from your experience into everyday life. If you can glean at least one lesson you learned, and convert it into a small change that you can incorporate into your daily life, that is how lasting transformation is created.

While no trip can be fully controlled, following these guidelines can reduce the likelihood of negative experiences. Always be intentional, and <span className="bold-underline">stay safe</span>!

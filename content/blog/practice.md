Many people put pressure on themselves to sit in meditation because they feel they _should_, only to judge themselves when they don't live up to their own expectations. 

This very relationship with meditation can reinforce the same cycle of attachment and suffering that the practice is intended to alleviate.

But meditation doesn't always need to be a structured routine that requires setting aside huge blocks of time. Meditation is a _practice_ on the cushion for life off the cushion. So why not remove the pressure by bringing the practice into everyday life?

The practice is simple: <span className="bold-underline">"begin again"</span>. Any time, any where, the moment you remember to practice, simply **"begin again"**. It is a simple choice, in each moment, to be fully present with whatever you are doing.

Eventually, the gaps in between periods of mindfulness begin to shorten, and the line between "practice" and "life" starts to dissolve.

You may _think_ you're living in the present already, but for most of us, unless we make an honest effort to practice, our mind is endlessly thinking about the past or worrying about the future. We're almost never "right here, right now". 

But it is in the present moment that we find, quite literally, everything that we seek. Our True Nature, God, Happiness, and Peace are only available in the **Now**.

And the **Now** is always available.

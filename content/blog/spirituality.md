"Spirituality" can sound like a 4-letter word to some. 

Many of us are traumatized in one way or another by our religious experience growing up, and so we are adverse or resistant to anything that resembles "spirituality". The mere mention of "God" can trigger discomfort or even rage. 

As a former Christian, and as a former Atheist— I get it. But spirituality is not the same thing as religion. It is not belief in God or deities. 

<span className="bold-underline">Spirituality</span> means acknowledging that we are all inextricably connected to something greater than ourselves. And a [spiritual practice](/daily) means tending to our non-physical selves, which is arguably just as important as our physical self. 

There's a reason "mind, body, and spirit" are considered one. Yet in the West, we tend to treat only the physical body, ignoring the underlying spiritual causes of imbalance.

Even an Agnostic can appreciate there is _something_— some energy, some force, some intelligence— that pervades all of existence.  After all, science has proven that **everything** is energy vibrating at different frequencies.

Have you ever gotten the chills when you weren't cold? Or felt an inexplicable tingling sensation? This is life force energy known as **Qi**. 

In the West, we often dismiss Eastern spiritual concepts in favor of "logic" and "science." But just as the West and East reflect different perspectives, so do science and spirituality— they are two sides of the same coin.

We like to believe we already know it all. But the truth is: we don't.

Stay humble, stay curious— there is always more to learn. And that, at least in part, is what spirituality is really about.

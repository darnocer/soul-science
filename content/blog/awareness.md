Awareness, awareness, awareness!

It is easy to get caught up in the cycle of _"I should do this..."_, _"I need to do that..."_, constantly feeling like there's more to fix. 

But truthfully, all you really need to do is **increase your awareness**. 

How do you do that? 

Like anything else, it is [a practice](/practice). Meditation is the classic approach, but you can practice mindfulness anywhere, anytime. 

As you increase your awareness, you become more aware of everything: your attachments, your speech, your habits, your relationships, your emotions, your thoughts, your moods, your behaviors. 

You begin to see nearly everything about your external reality is shaped by your own internal perceptions. 

You may already cognitively know this, but the more aware you are, the more you will feel how true this really is. 

Of course, once you recognize that which no longer serves you, there is still the work of [leaving, changing, or accepting](/happiness) the situation. 

But the hard work of noticing it in the first place will already be done. 

Expand your awareness, and watch your problems begin to dissolve.

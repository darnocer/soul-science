There are many forms of meditation, and though advanced practitioners may use other techniques, meditation will almost always involve a **"meditation object"**. 

A **meditation object** is a focus point in which you rest your attention on during practice. It serves as an anchor point to return to when the mind inevitably wanders, helping you cultivate the concentration required for deeper states of meditation. 

You may work with the same meditation object for years. Most commonly, this object will be the breath, which is always present. 

But meditation objects can vary and you can work with them in different ways. Below are a few examples:

##### <span className="list-heading">Breath</span>
When using the breath as your meditation object, choose a specific point of focus such as the rising and falling of the chest or abdomen, or the sensation of air passing through the nostrils. Stick with your chosen spot for the duration of the session to deepen concentration.

##### <span className="list-heading">Body Scans</span>
Starting at the top of your head and slowly moving down to your feet, bring gentle awareness in your mind to each part of the body, noticing any sensations that arise. If you become distracted, simply return to the top of your head and begin again.

##### <span className="list-heading">Counting</span>
A simple technique is to count down from 10 to 1, aligning each number with an inhale or exhale. For example: _Inhale_ - 10, _Exhale_ - 9, _Inhale_ - 8, _Exhale_ - 7… If you lose track, start again at 10.

##### <span className="list-heading">Physical Objects (Open-Eyed Meditation)</span>
Soften your gaze and focus on a simple, fixed object. This could also be a candle flame. Keep your attention steady while maintaining relaxed awareness.

##### <span className="list-heading">Visual Field (Closed Eyes)</span>
With eyes closed, observe the subtle patterns, colors, or darkness in your visual field. Simply notice what appears without trying to change it.

##### <span className="list-heading">Chants & Mantras</span>
Repeating a word or phrase, either silently or aloud, can stabilize attention. Common examples include "_Om_," "_Om Mani Padme Hum_," or "_Om Shanti Om_."

##### <span className="list-heading">Metta</span>
Metta, or loving-kindness meditation, involves repeating phrases directed toward yourself and others to cultivate goodwill and compassion. Like chanting, it uses words as a point of concentration. See the [guide to Metta](/metta) for details.

##### <span className="list-heading">Stillness</span>
An active body reflects an active mind. By focusing on the stillness of your posture, you can use your body's unmoving presence as an anchor for deep concentration.

##### <span className="list-heading">Open Awareness</span>
Technically the absence of a meditation object, Open Awareness may naturally arise over time after developing deeper concentration. Open Awareness involves observing all perceptions and sensations as they arise, without fixating on any single one.

The real practice with meditation objects is to train your mind to notice when it is distracted, and return— again and again— until returning is no longer needed, because you never leave the present moment ;)

Happiness is not an aspiration for a future state, nor is it a state we can arrive at permanently. It's only ever possible to be happy in the present moment— right <span className="bold-underline">NOW</span>.

There is not a future point in time when your life will magically be devoid of all problems and you'll have all of your desires fulfilled so you can finally be happy.

Achieving results or goals may bring happiness for a brief moment, but it's only temporary, and not a ticket to lasting fulfillment.

Resolve to let go of the results and fall in love with the process— showing up each day with curiosity and a willingness to experiment, rather than fixating on the end goal.

Take things less seriously— smile at mistakes, looking for the lessons in each failure.

Choose joy in each moment. After all, if you’re not enjoying life, what’s the point?

Above all, make [The Choice](/choice) to live in the present moment, the only place where true happiness is always available.

When you really settle into the journey that is life, you can accept it fully with all of its ups and downs, rather than living from one milestone to the next, perpetually dissatisfied with each successive accomplishment.

When you fully surrender to the present and let go of preoccupation with the future, it is easier to take meaningful action in the moment— actions that, ironically, better served your future self.

Knowing this, it feels almost absurd not to prioritize making an effort to live in the present moment— the only place where life actually happens.

In the end, there's no where to arrive.

**You're already here.**

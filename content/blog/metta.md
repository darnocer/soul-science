> [!info] Note there are many variations of Metta practice, this is just one approach!

## Overview 
<span className="bold-underline">Metta</span>, or "Loving-Kindness", is a powerful form of meditation practice rooted in cultivating compassion and goodwill. It involves repeating the _Metta phrases_ repeatedly for different categories of people, concentrating on the meaning. 

## Instructions 
Always beginning by directing loving-kindness towards yourself,  you will repeat the _Metta phrases_ (see [below](#metta-phrases)) in order, focusing on the meaning behind the words and the chosen person for the given category. You are not forcing feelings of loving-kindness, you are simply concentrating on the phrases and allowing feelings of Metta to develop naturally over time. 

If you are just beginning with Metta, dedicate an entire session, or multiple sessions, solely to cultivating Metta for yourself before progressing to the other categories (see [categories below](#metta-categories)). Once you feel ready to move on, still always start each session by offering Metta to yourself even for a few minutes in order to "connect" before shifting focus to the next category.

### Metta Phrases
> 1. May you be safe 🙏🏼
> 2. May you be happy 🙏🏼
> 3. May you be healthy 🙏🏼
> 4. May you be at ease 🙏🏼

### Metta Categories
1. **Self** - You!
2. **Benefactor** - A teacher, mentor, or someone you look up to
3. **'Dear Friend'** - Someone very close to you 
4. **A neutral person** - Someone you see occasionally but know _nothing_ about (eg. a store clerk)
5. **A difficult person** - Someone in your life whom you have a challenging relationship with, or feelings of aversion or resentment towards. This could be a colleague, family member, or even a public figure or politician. (Remember, there are NO exceptions!)
6. **All Beings** - All Beings in existence every where. (See more details about working with this category in the section [below](#working-with-all-beings)).


### Guidelines for Choosing Recipients of Metta
- Trust your intuition when selecting someone for each Metta category— avoid overthinking here.
- Avoid selecting life partners or romantic partners, as these types of relationships can often come with complex emotions that may make it difficult to maintain concentration. 
- Choose someone you can easily visualize a mental image of during practice.
- Stick with the same person for a given category for the entire session.
- You may work with the same person for a given category for days, weeks, or even months.
- Difficulty generating Metta for someone is often a sign to stick with the person longer rather than switching prematurely. 
- If someone evokes strong distress, it is always okay to step back and focus on "easier" categories before revisiting them.
- This practice includes everyone— there are NO exceptions :) 

> [!default] Remember! 
> 
> Metta is not about changing or influencing the person you choose; it's about transforming your own internal relationship with them through cultivation of compassion and goodwill. 

### Working with the phrases
- When you start with "Self," simply replace "you" with "I". 
- You can modify the phrases slightly to what feels meaningful to you, as long as there are 4 phrases aligned to these core themes that you can repeat in order each time. 
- When working with others, consider how the phrases might be understood from their perspective, as their interpretation of the phrase's meanings may differ from your own. 
- Progress through the phrases slowly and gently, allowing a brief pause in between each to fully absorb their meaning. 

#### Working with "All Beings"

There are a few approaches when working with the "All Beings" categories. You can choose the method or a combination of methods that resonates with you. 

##### <span className="list-heading">Pick 'Opposite' groups of people that include everyone</span>

This approach can often illuminate where we may hold preferences or biases towards certain groups of people. In this method, we practice Metta for both groups equally, cultivating a more inclusive heart. 


**Examples may include:** 

- Democrats and Republicans
- Males and Female 
- Young and Old
- Rich and Poor
- Friends and Strangers 
- Fans of [my favorite sports team] and non-fans



##### <span className="list-heading">The Expanding Circle</span>

 This approach involves visualizing a small circle around you that gradually expands outward to eventually encompass all beings. You can visualize this circle as light, energy, or an expanding feeling of warmth.


**For example, the progression you might visualize:** 

- Yourself
- Beings in your immediate vicinity
- ... in your house
- ... in your neighborhood
- ... in your town
- ... in your city
- ... in your state
- ... in your region
- ... in your country
- ... on your continent
- ... in your hemisphere 
- ... on Earth
- ... in the Universe 


##### <span className="list-heading">All Beings Subcategories</span>

This method is directly from the Buddhist suttas (teachings), where the Buddha encouraged extending loving-kindness to all beings without exception. For each of the 12 categories listed below, you will repeat all 4 Metta phrases, resulting in _48 total recitations_ during the session. 

Feel free to modify these categories to better align with your own perspective and inclusivity.

**"All Beings" subcategories include:** 
1. May All Beings ... [^1]
2. May All Living Beings ...
3. May All Breathing Beings ... 
4. May All Individuals ... 
5. May All Beings in Existence ... 
6. May All Females ...
7. May All Males ...
8. May All Enlightened Beings ... [^2]
9. May All Unenlightened Beings ... 
10. May All Devas and Brahmas ... [^3]
11. May All Human Beings ... 
12. May All Beings in Lower Realms ... [^4]

## Conclusion

Mindfulness is often seen as a practice of the "mind", whereas Metta is considered more "heart"-centered, at least in the West. In the original teachings, however, the term _citta_ translates to "heart-mind," as there is no distinction between heart and mind. You may find as you deepen your practice, the line between Metta and Mindfulness begins to blur.

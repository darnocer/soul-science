<span className="bold-underline">Grounding techniques</span> help center your awareness and bring you back to the present moment, especially if you feel overwhelmed or anxious. These are simple, effective tools that can be used anytime, anywhere.

#### <span className="list-heading">5-4-3-2-1 Senses Exercise</span>

Using your senses to connect with your surroundings can help ground you in the present moment: 

- **5 things** you can _see_ (eg. a plant, your hands, the sky)  
- **4 things** you can *feel* (eg. clothing, the floor)  
- **3 things** you can *hear* (eg. birds, music, your breath)  
- **2 things** you can *smell* (eg. essential oils, fresh air)  
- **1 thing** you can *taste* (eg. water, a piece of fruit)

**4-7-8 Breathing:**

There is a fine line between _mythology_ and _religion_. This is not to suggest that religion is illegitimate, but rather to recognize the legitimacy of both mythology and religions as meaningful ways to understand the world. 

We often associate "myths" with falsehood or fiction, but mythology is much more than that. Mythology includes sacred stories, supernatural beings, cosmology, and moral teachings— just like religion. Both are frameworks that attempt to explain the nature of reality and human existence; both involve gods or spirits, and both convey spiritual truths through symbols and storytelling. 

The main difference is not in substance, but perspective. A religion is a living tradition, actively practiced and followed, while a myth is a once-revered belief system that is no longer widely practiced. **A myth is essentially a religion that no longer has followers.**

Throughout history, mystics have recognized that the ultimate nature of reality cannot easily be captured with words, which is why both mythology and religions rely on symbols, allegories, and parables to express deep truths. Dismissing mythology while embracing religion overlooks that the same profound, symbolic storytelling is contained in both. 

Many myths have parallels to religious stories and strikingly similar themes, reflecting humanity's attempts to understand existence. In the Egyptian myth of **Osiris**, he is betrayed, killed, and resurrected, paralleling **Jesus's** crucifixion and resurrection. The Greek myth of **Prometheus**, who stole fire from the gods to enlighten humanity and was punished, mirrors the story of **Adam and Eve**, where gaining forbidden knowledge leads to both enlightenment and suffering. These parallels, whether labeled mythology or religion, serve the same purpose— to convey deep truths about knowledge, existence, and the nature of reality. 

By studying mythology with the same reverence as religion, we can broaden our perspective of how humanity has grappled with the mystery of the unknown throughout all of history. While some may dismiss both as fiction, these sacred stories transcend time, offering wisdom that helps us shape our understanding of the ourselves and the world.

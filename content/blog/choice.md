When choosing to walk a spiritual Path, there comes a time when one must make <span className="bold-underline">The Choice</span>: A conscious decision to play an active role in their Truth-seeking journey.

This **Choice** alerts Spirit that you are ready to be a conscious participant in the _Game of Life_. Once the Choice is made, don't be surprised when the Universe starts communicating back to you. 

> This is the moment of embarking,
> All auspicious signs are in place.

As part of making **The Choice**, we must also commit to [daily self-cultivation](/daily).

Our practice is a subtractive process. By removing that which doesn't serve our greater purpose, it shortens the gap between where we are and our Destiny.

Through daily dedication to our spiritual practice, the veil is lifted; we begin to see things as they truly are.

And things truly are beautiful. It is this deep appreciation and awe of the beauty that already surrounds us that moves us closer towards the Love & Light of the Absolute Truth.
